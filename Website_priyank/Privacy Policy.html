<h3>Information automatically tracked during App Usage</h3>
	<p class="sub-title font-blog">
		Cookies: To improve the responsiveness of the Site for our users, we may use “cookies”, or similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique, random number as a User Identification (User ID) to understand the user’s individual interests using the identified computer. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we will have no way of knowing who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive. Our partners may also assign their own cookies to your browser (if you click on their ads), a process that we do not control.
		<br><br>
		Log File Information: Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your device’s connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our website or mobile App. Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data — such as the web pages you view. We automatically receive and log information from the Mobile App, your browser, including but not limited to your IP address, your computer’s name, your operating system, browser type and version, CPU speed, and
		connection speed. We may also collect log information from your device, including your location, IP address, your device’s name, device’s serial number or unique identification number, your device operating system, browser type and version, CPU speed, and connection speed etc. Clear GIFs: We may use “clear GIFs” (Web Beacons) to track the online usage patterns of our users in an anonymous manner, without personally identifying the user. We may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. We use this information to inter-alia deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our Website /Mobile App to the interests of our users, to measure traffic within our Website/Mobile App, to improve the Website/Mobile app quality, functionality and interactivity and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where our visitors come.
		<br><br>
		SMS Inbox Information and Backup: The Mobile App also collects information related to business messages and other information arising out of transactions made from cards, banks or while using other services through the Mobile App user’s SMS inbox. The Mobile App does not collect information from personal messages, i.e. messages originating from 10 digit phone numbers. The collection of such information is only limited to the extent that such data is available in the relevant messages. BISL may also record the identity of the product or service and the price or fee paid or payable in respect thereof. If you have Backup switched on in the Mobile App, the Mobile App stores your business SMS information securely at our backend servers to enable you to switch devices without losing your data.
		<br><br>
	</p>
<h3>Your Data is Secure</h3>
<p class="sub-title font-blog">
		When you register for the Services, the Website/Mobile App requires a Login ID and a password from you for your privacy and security. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Login ID and password and you may not provide these credentials to any third party. We recommend that you change your password periodically.
		<br><br>
		Your password must conform to standards. We shall not be responsible if someone else accesses your account through Login ID and password they have obtained from you or through a violation by you of this Policy or the Website’s/Mobile App Terms of Use.
		<br><br>
		While accessing your SMS, the Website/Mobile App use a combination of firewall barriers, encryption techniques and authentication procedures, among others, to maintain the security of your online session, and to protect Website/Mobile App accounts and systems from unauthorized access. From the time you submit your Login ID and password, these communications between your computer/mobile and the Website/Mobile App are encrypted using at least 128-bit secure socket layer technology (SSL). This enables client and server applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering and message forgery. The Website/Mobile App also encrypts your Website/Mobile App password so that your password cannot be recovered, even by us.
		<br><br>
		In respect of KYC information provided by you for enabling the online mutual fund transactions and the mutual fund transaction details, such information would be also available with third party technology service provider/main distributor/AMCs/RTAs/authorised service providers and treated as proprietary and confidential in nature by them and to be used/shared/maintained/processed by them only on need to know basis for service enablement.
